"""
Represents an Author of a blog post.

This file includes 2 new concepts
1. UUIDs <- Don't bother learning this yet -- it's a unique string generator, let's say.
2. Properties -- if you found yourself writing methods to help you encapsulate your attributes safely,
    this is a 'more pythonic' way of doing it.
    You could have almost as easily defined a `get_name` and `set_name` method, instead.
